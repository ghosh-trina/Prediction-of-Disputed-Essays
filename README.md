# Prediction-of-Disputed-Essays

The objective of the project was to predict the author of the famous Hamilton-Madison disputed essays.

2 algorithms: k-mean clustering and decision trees classification were used to predict the authors.

Each row of the dataset contained the frequency of 72 common words found in essays wriiten by Hamilton, Madison and another author Jay acting as a constant.

With the k-means algorithm, 7 essays were classified to be written by Hamilton and 4 by Madison.
However, with the decision tree model, all 11 essays were classified to be written by Madison which is precise as per studies conducted by scholars and subject matter experts.
Therefore, the decision tree model proved to be a better algorithm for predicting the authors of the disputed essays data.
